# HCE

The main goal of this project is to develop an infrastructure capable of
emulating how NFC-based payments work. The core of this implementation
will be the two mobile applications: one will emulate the Customer,
the other the Merchant. Then, different servers will be deployed to simulate
how the banksâ€™ network works
